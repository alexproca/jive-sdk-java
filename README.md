# Jive Purposeful Places Framework (Java)
 Purposeful Places are a brand integration framework for Jive 7 that allows you to quickly and easily external activity streams and content from virtually any system.
 Here's [a high level overview of Purposeful Places](https://github.com/jivesoftware/jive-sdk/blob/master/docs/overview.md). Please make sure to post your feedback and comments in the [Jive Developer Community](https://community.jivesoftware.com/community/developer).

 Currently this project is in early development.  The javascript node framework is much more mature. https://github.com/jivesoftware/jive-sdk
 If you choose to use this project at this state, be prepared to fork the repo and make bug fixes and changes to the api (and please submit them back for review)

 To get started look in the example directory.

 You need your own servlet or http server,  injection framework, and persistence framework.  The example uses jersey/glassfish/hk2 and
 persists to a single file.
